# What Is Street Photography?

Street photography can be many things and bleeds into many other genres of photography.

To me street photography is a documentation of what is there, always candid, never posed. Street photos do not have to include humans, but there must be a human influence depicted in the scene.

A lot of people seem to have a more rigid or looser stance on the genre but as vague as everyone's definitions are on street, one thing is for sure. You will know it when you see it.
