# Mess up your first page

That way you will not feel pressured to post some staggering genius that will inevitably never be posted.

The pressure to start, to begin, or create always feels overwhelming to me because of the idea that it must be perfect, polished, and perfected right off the top. As unrealistic as this is, this is all too common. "Perfect is the Enemy of Good" so let's just start with this, not anything special, but a place to begin, a place to look back, to progress from, a place to just start.

This is one of the first "Street" photo I took on Queen and Ossington St. I passed by and noticed her intense gaze out the window. I hurried back with my camera and quickly focused on her and fired the shutter. I only took one photograph of her, and regret that I did not stick around and work the scene more. Important reminder to always work the scene, I rather regret taking a photo than not, at least that way I have something to show for it. I love the colors and rendering of the Zeiss 50mm Sonnar. I go back and forth on whether I like my own reflection in the shot or not.
