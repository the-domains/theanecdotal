  If your photograph sucks, a modern camera isn't going to help, in the
  immediate sense. What I mean by that is, some cameras will have quirks, errors
  and limitations. Limitations are good, they allow you to innovate on your
  approach to your photography. If your camera is slow to focus, prefocus and
  wait for the subject to enter that plane of focus. This creates a new way to
  shoot and new experiences which will help you creatively in the long run. If
  your camera is large and not "stealth" then use that to it's advantages. Use
  the presence of the camera and photographer to make a statement through your
  subjects.

# Your Camera Doesn't Matter

That is to say, for most of art photography. The truth is that most modern and even non modern cameras produce great images. At the end of the day you have to ask yourself, will anyone care what camera I took this photo with? did the camera hinder or cultivate my creativity? and the most important question "is my photograph any good?"

If your photograph sucks, a modern camera isn't going to help, in the immediate sense. What I mean by that is, some cameras will have quirks, errors and limitations. Limitations are good, they allow you to innovate on your approach to your photography. If your camera is slow to focus, prefocus and wait for the subject to enter that plane of focus. This creates a new way to shoot and new experiences which will help you creatively in the long run. If your camera is large and not "stealth" then use that to it's advantages. Use the presence of the camera and photographer to make a statement through your subjects. ![Man hugs homeless man on Church and Wellesley. Toronto, Ontario.

Of course if you want to shoot photos of birds and all you have is a wide angle fixed lens compact it may pose too great of a limitation, but you should experience that yourself before you put down thousands of dollars on a brand new camera. For every technical solution you can fix with buying new gear, there is a more creative solution that will make you a better photographer in the long run. Buying gear can get addicting and it's fun to read all the reviews and geek out on all the tech, but you have to ask yourself did you get into photography to buy gear? or to make photographs? I admit it doesn't have to be one or the other, but often times people forget about making photographs, and focus more on megapixels, and this brand vs. that brand.

You make your photographs, your camera just records the image.
