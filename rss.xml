            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Your Camera Doesn't Matter</h1><p>If your photograph sucks, a modern camera isn't going to help, in the immediate sense. What I mean by that is, some cameras will have quirks, errors and limitations. Limitations are good, they allow you to innovate on your approach to your photography. If your camera is slow to focus, prefocus and wait for the subject to enter that plane of focus. This creates a new way to shoot and new experiences which will help you creatively in the long run. If your camera is large and not "stealth" then use that to it's advantages. Use the presence of the camera and photographer to make a statement through your subjects. </p></article>]]></description>
